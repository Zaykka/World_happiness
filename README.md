# Final project
### Description:
The goal of the final project is for you to demonstrate your skills in collecting and analyzing information using the Python programming language. You are expected to choose a research topic that is interesting to you and involves the use of data. You need to use the acquired knowledge and skills in web scraping, parsing and combining several datasets. After collecting data, you need to perform exploratory data analysis, in which you need to: study data types, descriptive statistics, clear data from missing values and outliers, create categories (bins), preprocess and transform features. It is necessary to build at least 3 graphs and interpret them. Each chart should contain at least the title and axis labels. In the description of the plot, you need to draw conclusions about what this graph showed, and what interesting questions and answers or insights it can bring to the agenda. Secondly, you need to select one of the possible options of the further analysis: network (graph) analysis, sentiment (text) analysis, default prediction.
### Grading criteria:
* The purpose of the study is clearly stated (1 point);
* All steps of the research process are described in a clear and concise way (2 points);
* Research outcomes are clearly defined (2 points);
* Includes intuitive visualizations of research outcomes (2 points);
* All members of the project team are able to explain the code used for computations (1
points);
* Code is properly structured (1 point);
* Meets submission timeline (1 point).
